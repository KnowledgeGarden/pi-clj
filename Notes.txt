OBSERVATIONS
  PI.html is really a concatination of several files. Each of those should be either a clj file or a new
    path
      One file Each
  CAN clojure return a Map which would be equivalent to my IResult?
    I think so

    Moving to Github with Paul Thagard's kind permission

    Started project with lein in VSCode
    Gathering resources
    It's tempting to just copy the lisp files directly into clj files then transliterate from
      there
    BUG: core.clj is not compiling load_all
  20210320
    added pi.lisp
    added wts.clj - the wave theory of sound data
    wts.clj compiles but does not run 
      Needs Transliteration
    APPEARS that we don't need core.clj load_all because just making wts.clj a dependency
      on core.clj gets it started.
      Then all you need to do is transliterate, add dependencies, which brings them in
    (loop [index 0]
  (if (> (inc index) (count str))
  nil
  (if (= (nth str index) char)
    true
    (recur (inc index)))))
