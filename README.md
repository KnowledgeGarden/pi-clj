# pi-clj
Paul Thagard's PI system transliterated form Lisp to Clojure - work very much in progress

See P. Thagard, Computational Philosophy of Science, 1988.

Made with Lein.

For now, this is a reproduction of the lisp code (see /doc/pi.lisp
with various transliterations in progress.

The process is not at all being conducted in a Clojiure-like mannter; rather core.clj is aimed at a working project - Wave Theory of Sound - and exceptions which occur during *lein run* become the targets for transliteration.

Collaboration on this project is invited.
